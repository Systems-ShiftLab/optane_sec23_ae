## Remote Wear-levelling Covert Channel

This directory contains code for our cross-network covert channel.

- `sender.c` is code for the remote client, which sends a message
- `receiver.c` is code for another remote client, which retrives the secret message
- `*.py` files generate accuracy numbers from the results

## Noteboard attack Covert Channel

This directory contains code for our Noteboard attack.

- `sender.c` is code for the remote client, which encodes a secret message
- `receiver.c` is code for another remote client, which retrives the secret message
- `msg.txt` contains the secret message
- `postprocess.py` generates the accuracy numbers from after the experiment
